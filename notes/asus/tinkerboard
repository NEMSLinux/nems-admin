//Fails:
//Grab the latest version of Debian from https://tinker-board.asus.com/download-list.html?product=tinker-board-s
//SSH in linaro:linaro and sudo su

Grab the latest Armbian Bullseye: https://armbian.hosthatch.com/archive/tinkerboard/archive/

Prep as usual.

Because ASUS doesn't release a "lite" version of Debian, the build itself must be done via terminal (not SSH); will lose SSH connection mid-install due to all the purged packages.

Via connected keyboard/monitor, build as usual on TTY2: ./nems-build.sh 100
